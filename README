Current notes and how to build:

See below on more info on compiling and making shared libraries for
external scripts.  You should have a recent and working version of
ROOT and GEANT4.  You also need all of the G4 data files including
hadron xsecs etc.  Those are the only requirements.  The code should
work with gcc 4.3.

To compile:
make clean
make rootcint
make

Notes from Alex Beutel 8/09:

[note from Chris: we took out the upright option... double check the
relation between this and the flag in the geometry file.
This is a job for Johannes.]

Mailbox geometry needs a lot of work.  There are many warnings and
errors when run as currently set up.  Also still need to add PMTs to
top semi-ciruclar caps.  This also does not use standard configuration
variables as used in all other geometries.

When adding configurations, make sure to also add appropriately to
WCSimDetectorMessenger and keep mind the orientation variable which is
in RootGeom and written to the geomfile.txt.  This may want to be
rewritten to be called geometry because mailbox isn't really an
orientation.  However, this is important to be adapted into superscan
similarly to how I used it in TJ's root display.

To compile:
make clean
make rootcint
make

When linking do both:
make shared
make libWCSim.a  	<-- this will generate an error for part of it, don't worry about it

For compiling TJs RootDisplay point system variable G42KMWORKDIR at this folder as seen below:

setenv G42KMWORKDIR "/var/phy/project/hep/neutrino/work/amb79/justwater"
