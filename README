Current notes and how to build:
-----

This version of WCSim has been moved to GitHub.  You should make new
features by making a feature branch off of develop and then ask for a
pull request.

The repository contains the following branches:

- master: (this is only used for releases).  Do not put development here.
- development: This is the development branch.  Feature branches start here.
- feature: These are branches where you work on new features.  
- archive: these are old historical work branches from the WCSim Duke SVN repository.

-----
You should have a recent and working version of
ROOT and GEANT4.  (Known to work with GEANT 4.9.4.p01.)
You also need all of the G4 data files including
hadron xsecs etc.  Those are the only requirements.  The code should
work with gcc 4.3.

To compile:
make clean
make rootcint
make

If you want to use these libraries with an external program then also do:

make shared      [ For root programs]
make libWCSim.a  [ Also necessary for the event display?]

More detailed information about the simulation is available in doc/DetectorDocumentation.pdf.
