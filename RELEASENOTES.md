                       v1.2.0        
*************************************************************
Bug Fixes
* Missing HK variables added so that the HK geometry could be specified as the default and the code won't crash. 
* HasSubEvents() function now returns the proper Boolean value. 
* Dark noise is now added between the start of the trigger window and the start of the signal. 

Structural Changes
* All of the different detector setups were moved into a file called WCSimDetectorConfigs.cc.
* WCSimPMTQE.cc was created and all quantum efficiency info was put there.
* WCSimWCDigitizer was split into a PMT collection (in the newly created WCSimWCPMT file) and a digitizer collection.
* The PMT information was put into a single file called WCSimPMTObject.cc. PMTs now inherit from the newly created WCSimPMTObject class. 

New Features
* Python script was added to generate kinematics files for simple particles. 
* A (very) basic validation script was added in a new directory called verification-test-scripts. The verification_HitsChargeTime.C script checks the hits, charge, and timing of events against a clean copy of the WCSim code. 
* HPDs were added to the list of possible tubes allowed in WCSim.
* Hyper-K with HPDs was added as a new detector configuration.
