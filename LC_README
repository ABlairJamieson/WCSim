Note for the Light Cone usage:
1- the command ConstructLC setup the LC: 
true to set the LCs, otherwise false.

2- There is an additional primary particles generator to fill uniformely
the FV, to use it do the following:
i- /mygen/generator fill

ii-Set the type of the particles and its energy as usual with the commands
/gun/particle and /gun/energy

iii-There is a file genfile.txt containing the positions and the directions
of 1e5 particles, if more statistics are needed a biggest file might be 
generated in the same format. Make sure to have the right path to this file
into the WCSimPrimaryGeneratorAction.cc.
