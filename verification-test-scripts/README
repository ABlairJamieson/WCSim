This directory contains scripts to test the output of your current version of WCSim with the version on GitHub. The purpose of these scripts is to ensure that the changes being committed will not accidentally change the output of the WCSim code. 

Below is a description of the scripts in this directory:

verification_HitsChargeTime.C: 

This script will test a .root output file from your version of WCSim against the committed version of the code. This test plots the number of digitized hits, the average charge, and the average time. A ks test is printed to the screen. This test also prints to the screen a comparison of the first event in the files to see if the number of hit tubes, number of digitized tubes, and number of pe hit times match. 

To use this test, the default method is to clone a copy of the current code from GitHub into a directory called WCSim_clean. Run a script in both your local WCSim (with your changes you wish to commit) and your newly created WCSim_clean directory (for example, run 10 electrons with energy 500 MeV using the default novis.mac in both directories). To use the default method, both files must be called wcsim.root. Then, in the verification-test-scripts of your local WCSim directory, type: root verification_HitsChargeTime.C . 

You can also use this test to compare any two files from any two directories. To use the script this way type:
root 
.x verification_HitsChargeTime.C("name_of_first_file", "name_of_second_file")
